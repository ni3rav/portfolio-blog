Hive lets you write and manage all your content and metadata in one clean place, then pull it straight into whatever framework or frontend you prefer. No tangled infra. No mystery middleware. Just your content, your stack, and a clean pipe between them.

What started as one of my side projects quickly grew into something bigger. Once I understood the real problem it was trying to solve, I scrapped the early version and teamed up with my friend Supal Vasani (She did most of the frontend part which includes the theme). From that point forward, both of us built Hive together, faster and far better than the first draft ever deserved.

Building Hive was challenging and rewarding at the same time. We picked up a lot: cleaner code, proper API docs, a few spicy git accidents, and the joy of actually collaborating. Some of our brainstorming and testing sessions were more fun than writing the code itself.
