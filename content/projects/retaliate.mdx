A lightweight implementation of React's core features including Virtual DOM and Fiber Architecture.

## Features

- JSX support through esbuild transpilation
- Virtual DOM implementation
- Fiber-based reconciliation
- Incremental rendering with requestIdleCallback
- Efficient diffing algorithm
- Development server with hot reload
- Production build support

## Limitations

- No state management system
- No side-effects handling (like React's useEffect)
- Limited event handling
- No component lifecycle methods

Future improvements will focus on implementing these features while maintaining the lightweight nature of the library.
